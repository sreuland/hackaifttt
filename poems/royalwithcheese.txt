But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
What?
It's the little differences. 
I mean, they got the same shit over there they got here, but, it's just, just, there it's a little different.
Example?
Alright, you can walk into a movie theatre in Amsterdam and buy a beer. 
And I don't mean just like in no paper cup. 
I'm talking about a glass of beer. 
And in Paris, you can buy a beer at McDonald's. 
And you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.
Then what do they call it?
They call it Royale with Cheese.
Royale with Cheese. What do they call a Big Mac?
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
Le big Mac! Ahhaha, what do they call a Whopper?
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.
