I’ll take 200 words and provide you with a fulfilling demonstration
It’s not the words I use but the words formation
Assuring that each line will share a translucent relation
Whether I’m giving praise or releasing frustration
But more importantly I can release my minds imagination
So if I write about love you’ll feel the sensation
If I write about sex you’ll feel the penetration
And if I write about the top of the world you’ll feel the elevation
Continuing to spit the truth in any situation regardless of the occasion
If my pen’s not welcomed to the paper then call it an invasion
So I guess now my pen is enlisted and area 51 is the station
The meaning of life is the ultimate unsolved equation
I try to dig out the Maker but He’s not falling for persuasion
Yet maybe He’s showing me and I can’t make out the translation
But who knows, the Makers not exactly into negotiation
So I stay in my place because I can’t afford a violation
Yet I’ll continue to speak my truth without any hesitation
You’re simply witnessing a pens dedication
My final line will be known as the cancelation
